/**
 * This file stores the data required to construct the graph i.e the edges and 
 * the nodes.The edges are stored as an array of objects, whereby the objects 
 * store the properties of the edge. The nodes are stored in a similar manner 
 * with the same logic.
 *
 * To add a new node simply create a new object with the relevant properties and
 * append it to the array (make sure to AVOID SYNTAX ERRORS!!). The same process
 * should be followed when adding new edges.
 *
 * Creating a new edge, the format is as follows:
 * {
 *  id: (this is a unique number represented as a string),
 *  type: (the edges link course in the same pathway, the type is simply the 
 *         Pathway that the nodes to be connected belong to. This disitinction 
 *         is useful when coloring the edges to indicate different pathways),
 *  from: (this is the ID of the node to be connected)
 *  to: (this is the ID of the other node to be connected)
 *  color: {
 *    {color: (the color of the edge. Each pathway has it's own unique color. 
 *             See key below for the color mappings)
 *     highlight: (same as above, this is just for the color when the edge has 
 *                 been clicked by a user)
 *    }
 *  }

As the course progresses, we will explore the variety of ways in which colonial subjects lived, worked, ate, worshipped, and socialized. Lectures and reading assignments will draw upon a variety of sources, including court cases, artistic renderings, city maps and street plans, travel accounts of visits to the regions, and the material, cultural, and intellectual products made possible by the wealth and dynamism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course will conclude with an analysis of the Age of Revolutions, a period of dramatic upheaval that remains at the center of lively scholarly debates. By the end of the semester, students will be able to engage the key questions driving these debates, the most important of which, perhaps, is: what is Latin America's colonial legacy?","path1":"intell_culture","path2":"religious_comm","path3":"slavery_race","pathways":["intell_culture","religious_comm","slavery_race"]}

How are we to make sense out of this seeming chaos? This course will offer an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. We will start with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to a modern nation state, followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey will focus on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally, 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity.","path1":"war_peace","path2":"human_rights","path3":"politics_rev","pathways":["war_peace","human_rights","politics_rev"]},{"id":"108","title":"HIST 108: American Origins","label":"HIST 108","courseDescription":"No Description Provided","path1":"intell_culture","path2":"slavery_race","path3":"politics_rev","pathways":["intell_culture","slavery_race","politics_rev"]},{"id":"123","title":"HIST 123: Economic History of Europe I","label":"HIST 123","courseDescription":"This course concentrates on the economy of Europe in the Early Modern Period, 1450-1750. It was a time of great transition. Europe developed from an agriculturally-based to an industrially-based economy, with attendant changes in society and culture. From a subsistence-level productivity, the European economy expanded to create great surfeits of good, with attendant changes in consumption and expectation. Europe grew from a regional economic system to become part—some would day the heart—of a global economy, with attendant changes in worldview and identity. Economic intensification, expansion, globalization and industrialization are our topics, therefore. Beginning with economic organizations and practices, we will consider how these changed over time and influenced society and culture. The course takes take as its point of departure the experience of individual, working men and women: peasants and artisans, merchants and landlords, entrepreneurs and financiers. Yet, it argues outward: from the particular to the general, from the individual to the social, from the local to the global. It will suggests ways in which the economy influenced developments or changes that were not in themselves economic, and it will seek the ways in which non-material, transcendent beliefs, systems or values shaped and deflected economic life and practice.","path1":"econ_history","path2":"historical_methods","pathways":["econ_history","historical_methods"]},{"id":"126","title":"HIST 126: Modern Europe, 1789-1919","label":"HIST 126","courseDescription":"It's old, it's new.

The century and a half we cover in this course witnessed the development of the political, economic, and cultural phenomena we often see as characteristic of modern society. Topics considered include political revolution, industrialization, war, liberalism, imperialism, totalitarianism, and new ideologies of gender, race, and class. Our focus will be consistently transnational. How did European imperialism reshape the globe? How can the making of modern Europe help us understand the current travails of the European Union? How did borders and boundaries operate at the edge of nations, but also within societies? We will investigate these questions as we follow European history from the violence and optimism of the French Revolution to the total war of the twentieth century.","path1":"econ_history","path2":"war_peace","path3":"politics_rev","pathways":["econ_history","war_peace","politics_rev"]},{"id":"131","title":"HIST 131: Financial Meltdown, Past and Present","label":"HIST 131","courseDescription":"Economic history is increasingly recognized as a crucial source of policy advice and is invoked with growing frequency in public debates.

This course begins with a review of the principal features of the subprime crisis of 2008 and asks, so to speak, \"how did we get there?\" It answers by providing historical insights that shed light on crucial aspects of financial disasters. This is a history course, engaging with topics pertaining to economics, law and politics (national and international). Students with diverse backgrounds are expected to benefit from this course through acquiring a concrete knowledge of the historical evolution of fundamental institutions of financial capitalism.

In the first half of the course, we will explore the long history across the West of the regulation of various kinds of ideas and their expression, from malicious gossip to heresies, and read classic arguments for and against censorship, copyright protections, and standards of taste and decency and of truth. In the second part of the seminar, after looking at how the idea of freedom of speech came to seem an essential prerequisite for democracy as well as individual liberty, we will take up the historical and philosophical questions posed by such recent dilemmas as whether or not hate speech deserves the protection of the First Amendment, the distinction between art and pornography from the perspective of freedom of expression, speech during wartime, and the transformative effects of the internet on the circulation and regulation of ideas. We will end the semester by thinking about the globalization of the idea of free speech as a human right and its implications, both positive and negative. Readings will range from Robert Darnton’s The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France, to D. H. Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover, to documents concerning the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo and law review articles about Citizens United v. FEC.

The critique of religion had vast implications for the meaning of human life, the nature of the person, and the conception of political and social existence. The course will explore the intensifying debate over religion in the intellectual history of Europe, reaching from the Renaissance, through the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, to the twentieth century. Figures we will read may include Machiavelli, Hobbes, Spinoza, Pascal, Locke, Rousseau, Voltaire, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. These thinkers allow us to trace the varieties of irreligious experience that have emerged in modern European thought and their implications for both historical and philosophical understanding. Rather than drawing a straight line from belief to non-belief, however, we will also consider whether religion lingers even in secular thought and culture.","path1":"intell_culture","path2":"religious_comm","pathways":["intell_culture","religious_comm"]},{"id":"150","title":"HIST 150: American Jewish Experience","label":"HIST 150","courseDescription":"This course offers a comprehensive survey of American Jewish history from the colonial period to the present.

This course analyzes the Cuban and Guatemalan revolutions, as well as social movements that transformed the United States: the black freedom movement, the labor movement, and changing forms of Latino politics. In all three countries, Americans looked for ways to reform capitalism or build socialism; address entrenched patterns of racism; define and realize democracy; and achieve national independence. They conceived of these challenges in dramatically different ways. Together, we’ll compare national histories and analyze the relationships between national upheavals. In studying the US and Latin America together, the class allows students to explore central questions in both regions’ histories. What did capitalism, socialism, and communism amount to? What did democracy mean? What were the roots of racial inequality and how did Americans address it? Why were Americans so enticed by economic growth, and how did they pursue it? How did the Cold War shape social movements? What purposes did unions serve? How did Christianity inform movements for and against social change? Studying these regions together also allows us to explore international interactions. How did the black freedom movement in the US relate to the Cuban revolution? How did Latin American immigration shape the US labor movement? How did US Cold War policy influence Latin American revolutionary movements? The goal of this class is for you to interpret the readings and decide what you think. What you learn in this class, and the quality of our experience together, depends on your reading closely, coming to class with informed ideas and questions, and being prepared to help your classmates answer theirs.

England was re-constructed as a republic, then with Scotland became the United Commonwealth of Great Britain, then declined into a military dictatorship, and finally invited the king back. In 1688, however, the Glorious Revolution deposed that king and declared Britain a strictly constitutional monarchy. This course will explore what motivated ordinarily obedient British subjects to take up arms against their rulers. The works of Milton and Marvell, Cromwell, Hobbes and Locke, and many lesser-known writers of diaries, autobiographies, sermons, statutes, and letters will illuminate the issues. The focus will be on how law, politics and religion interacted in the onset of war and defining of settlement, but with an eye to the larger social and cultural setting in which revolutions happened: this is also an era of both witchcraze and scientific revolution, puritanism and the slave trade, the near-destruction of London by fire and plague and its re-birth as the capital of a commercial empire.","path1":"law_society","path2":"religious_comm","path3":"politics_rev","pathways":["law_society","religious_comm","politics_rev"]},{"id":"313","title":"HIST 313: The French Revolution and the Origins of Modern Politics","label":"HIST 313","courseDescription":"This course will examine the social, cultural, intellectual, economic, and especially political history of France and its overseas (especially Caribbean) empire from the end of the Old Regime through the Napoleonic period.

Particular attention will be paid to the global legacy of these two late 18th-century revolutions in terms of such key modern political concepts as human rights, nationalism, social welfare, feminism, democracy, terrorism, and revolution itself. Throughout the course, we will also emphasize the different and often conflicting ways in which historians have interpreted the meaning and consequences of this critical moment of upheaval. Readings will be a mixture of primary and secondary sources, and classes will combine lecture and discussion.

The course approaches major works, dealing with the historical importance of information (Foucault, Innis, Habermas) and simultaneously discusses the rise and fall of institutions to store and circulate information.

Within that framework, the class invites students to think about several questions: How did the idea and practice of empire change over the twentieth century? How did the United States relate to new visions of independence emerging in Africa, Asia, and Latin America? How did global interactions both inform and reflect racial ideology in the United States?
