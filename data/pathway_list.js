    { label: 'HIST-051: Modern Britain',
      courseDescription: 'This course surveys British history from the eighteenth century to the present. In the first two centuries we\'ll study, Britain built an empire that ruled over a quarter of the globe and became the world\'s leading economy. In 2016, the Empire is gone, but coincident with its loss, Britain gained a welfare state and retained a role as a powerhouse of culture and finance. Themes emphasized in the course include national identity, class, political reform, war, and imperialism. How did Britain come to dominate the global economy and what did this dominance look like? How should we understand its role in the world today? Do the Beatles, the Royal Family, and Amy Winehouse add up to a "Cool Britannia" that has somehow "made up" for the loss of the Empire? How will the recent Brexit vote shape Britain\'s status in the future? Using written and visual primary sources, we\'ll look at all of these questions as we study the birth and development of modern Britain.'
