Emphasis on legal and political developments, cultural and religious history. Readings in texts from the period are supplemented by discussion of other kinds of primary sources -- paintings, woodcuts, buildings, and music."},{"label":"HIST 131: Financial Meltdown, Past and Present","courseDescription":"Economic history is increasingly recognized as a crucial source of policy advice and is invoked with growing frequency in public debates. In particular, the subprime crisis in 2008 and after has generated a demand for \"historical perspective\" that would improve the understanding of the causes of financial turmoil and facilitate the prevention of comparable catastrophes. This course begins with a review of the principal features of the subprime crisis of 2008 and asks, so to speak, \"how did we get there?\" It answers by providing historical insights that shed light on crucial aspects of financial disasters. This is a history course, engaging with topics pertaining to economics, law and politics (national and international). Students with diverse backgrounds are expected to benefit from this course through acquiring a concrete knowledge of the historical evolution of fundamental institutions of financial capitalism. Ultimately, students enrolling in this course are expected to achieve proficiency in historically informed discussion of the mechanisms that were played out in the subprime crisis and beyond."},{"label":"HIST 161: American Capitalism","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"},{"label":"HIST 168: History of American Law to 1877","courseDescription":"The course surveys the development of law in the U.S. to 1877, including such subjects as: the evolution of the legal profession, the transformation of English law during the American Revolution, the making and implementation of the Constitution, and issues concerning business and economic development, the law of slavery, the status of women, and civil rights."},{"label":"HIST 169: History of American Law Since 1877","courseDescription":"This course covers the development of legal rules and principles concerning individual and group conduct in the United States since 1877. Such subjects as regulation and deregulation, legal education and the legal profession, and the legal status of women and minorities will be discussed."},{"label":"HIST 312: Britain's Century of Revolution","courseDescription":"England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland experienced revolutions in the first half of the seventeenth century that abolished monarchy and hereditary aristocracy, and carried out the first judicial execution of a monarch in European history. England was re-constructed as a republic, then with Scotland became the United Commonwealth of Great Britain, then declined into a military dictatorship, and finally invited the king back. In 1688, however, the Glorious Revolution deposed that king and declared Britain a strictly constitutional monarchy. This course will explore what motivated ordinarily obedient British subjects to take up arms against their rulers. The works of Milton and Marvell, Cromwell, Hobbes and Locke, and many lesser-known writers of diaries, autobiographies, sermons, statutes, and letters will illuminate the issues. The focus will be on how law, politics and religion interacted in the onset of war and defining of settlement, but with an eye to the larger social and cultural setting in which revolutions happened: this is also an era of both witchcraze and scientific revolution, puritanism and the slave trade, the near-destruction of London by fire and plague and its re-birth as the capital of a commercial empire."},{"label":"HIST 333: Napoleonic Era & Tolstoy","courseDescription":"In this course we will read what many consider to be the greatest book in world literature. This work, Tolstoy's War and Peace, is devoted to one of the most momentous periods in world history, the Era of the French Revolutions and the Napoleonic Wars (1789-1815). We will study both the novel and the Napoleonic era: the military campaigns of Napoleon and his opponents, the grand strategies of the age, political intrigues and diplomatic betrayals, the ideologies and beliefs, the human dramas, and the relationship between art and history. How does literature help us to understand this era? How does history help us to understand this great novel? Because we will read War and Peace over the course of the entire semester, readings will be manageable (circa 100 pages of the epic and 50 pages of additional reading per week) – and very enjoyable."},{"label":"HIST 447: Histories of the Information Economy","courseDescription":"Information may be accumulated or lost; it can be safeguarded or debased; it can confer power or undermine it. Consistently, this course provides a perspective on information as historical actor. Beyond neoliberal narratives of the progress of the information economy driven by technological factors, the course underscores the importance of value (social, political, economic) which is at the heart of information gathering and information production. The course approaches major works, dealing with the historical importance of information (Foucault, Innis, Habermas) and simultaneously discusses the rise and fall of institutions to store and circulate information. This is achieved through an empirical, narrative approach, via the study of historical processes such as imperialism, state building, propaganda, the police archives and the politics of memory."}],"borders_migration":[{"name":"Borders, Migration and Immigration","color":{"color":"#7fb4a6","highlight":"#cdf0e7"},"description":"Lorem Ipsum"},{"label":"HIST 072: Introduction to Latin American and Latino Studies","courseDescription":"Designed to introduce students to the interdisciplinary field of Latin American and Latino Studies, this is a seminar oriented toward first and second year students.

In one respect, the twentieth century was a strange time to become a global empire: it was the period when colonial systems centered in Europe, Russia, Japan, and Turkey collapsed, and new nations emerged throughout Africa and Asia. This class explores the changing strategies of military, economic, and political intervention that the U.S. pursued as colonization lost legitimacy. Within that framework, the class invites students to think about several questions: How did the idea and practice of empire change over the twentieth century? How did the United States relate to new visions of independence emerging in Africa, Asia, and Latin America? How did global interactions both inform and reflect racial ideology in the United States? Finally, how did international affairs transform U.S. politics and social movements?"}],"intell_culture":[{"name":"Intellectual and Cultural Life","color":{"color":"#61c0bf","highlight":"#b1f2f1"},"description":"Lorem Ipsum"},{"label":"HIST 031: Making and Breaking European Hegemony","courseDescription":"Hist 031 will trace the dramatic rise and fall of Europe\\'s global hegemony during the period roughly from 1450 to 1950. Among the major themes we will examine are: states and power, borders and resistance, race and genocide, economies and oppression, ideas and revolution, the building and change of hierarchies of gender and power.

Readings in texts from the period are supplemented by discussion of other kinds of primary sources -- paintings, woodcuts, buildings, and music."},{"label":"HIST 070: Colonial Latin America","courseDescription":"This course provides an introduction to the broad literature on Latin America's rich colonial history. We will begin by tracing some of the early origins of - and points of contact between - the Indian, Iberian, and African men and women who formed the basis of colonial society. As the course progresses, we will explore the variety of ways in which colonial subjects lived, worked, ate, worshipped, and socialized. Lectures and reading assignments will draw upon a variety of sources, including court cases, artistic renderings, city maps and street plans, travel accounts of visits to the regions, and the material, cultural, and intellectual products made possible by the wealth and dynamism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course will conclude with an analysis of the Age of Revolutions, a period of dramatic upheaval that remains at the center of lively scholarly debates. By the end of the semester, students will be able to engage the key questions driving these debates, the most important of which, perhaps, is: what is Latin America's colonial legacy?"},{"label":"HIST 091: Modern Japanese History","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"},{"label":"HIST 096: Late Imperial China","courseDescription":"This course provides a broad survey of Chinese history from the Mongol invasion to the collapse of imperial order in 1911.

In the first half of the course, we will explore the long history across the West of the regulation of various kinds of ideas and their expression, from malicious gossip to heresies, and read classic arguments for and against censorship, copyright protections, and standards of taste and decency and of truth. In the second part of the seminar, after looking at how the idea of freedom of speech came to seem an essential prerequisite for democracy as well as individual liberty, we will take up the historical and philosophical questions posed by such recent dilemmas as whether or not hate speech deserves the protection of the First Amendment, the distinction between art and pornography from the perspective of freedom of expression, speech during wartime, and the transformative effects of the internet on the circulation and regulation of ideas. We will end the semester by thinking about the globalization of the idea of free speech as a human right and its implications, both positive and negative.

Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover, to documents concerning the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo and law review articles about Citizens United v. FEC.

No prior background in Jewish history is expected."},{"label":"HIST 143: Foundations of European Thought: from Rome to the Renaissance","courseDescription":"This course offers an introduction to the world of thought and learning at the heart of European culture, from the Romans through the Renaissance. We begin with the ancient Mediterranean and the formation of Christianity and trace its transformation into European society. Along the way we will examine the rise of universities and institutions for learning, and follow the humanist movement in rediscovering and redefining the ancients in the modern world."},{"label":"HIST 144: Foundations of Modern Thought","courseDescription":"“God is dead,” declared Friedrich Nietzsche, “and we have killed him.” Nietzsche’s words came as a climax of a longer history of criticism of, and dissent toward, the religious foundations of European society and politics. The critique of religion had vast implications for the meaning of human life, the nature of the person, and the conception of political and social existence. The course will explore the intensifying debate over religion in the intellectual history of Europe, reaching from the Renaissance, through the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, to the twentieth century. Figures we will read may include Machiavelli, Hobbes, Spinoza, Pascal, Locke, Rousseau, Voltaire, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. These thinkers allow us to trace the varieties of irreligious experience that have emerged in modern European thought and their implications for both historical and philosophical understanding. Rather than drawing a straight line from belief to non-belief, however, we will also consider whether religion lingers even in secular thought and culture."},{"label":"HIST 163: Modern American Culture","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"},{"label":"HIST 307: Love Lust & Violence in the Middle Ages","courseDescription":"Medieval Europe was undoubtedly gruff and violent but it also gave birth to courtly culture - raw worries transformed into knights who performed heroic deeds, troubadours wrote epics in their honor and love songs about their ladies, women of the elite carved out a place in public discourse as patrons of the arts, and princely courts were increasingly defined by pageantry from jousting tournaments to royal coronations. This course will trace the development of this courtly culture from the eleventh to the sixteenth century, from its roots in Southern France to its spread to Northern France and then to various kingdoms in Europe."},{"label":"HIST 311: The Tudors","courseDescription":"This course examines the history of England from the accession of Henry (VII) Tudor in 1485 to the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, with emphases on the political and personal history of this colorful dynasty, the religious revolution known as the protestant Reformation, the arts and literature known as the English Renaissance, imperial and trade ventures overseas, and aspects of popular culture including the witch craze.

Readings include fictional as well as analytical representations, and a film series will accompany the course."},{"label":"HIST 123: Economic History of Europe I","courseDescription":"This course concentrates on the economy of Europe in the Early Modern Period, 1450-1750. It was a time of great transition. Europe developed from an agriculturally-based to an industrially-based economy, with attendant changes in society and culture. From a subsistence-level productivity, the European economy expanded to create great surfeits of good, with attendant changes in consumption and expectation. Europe grew from a regional economic system to become part—some would day the heart—of a global economy, with attendant changes in worldview and identity. Economic intensification, expansion, globalization and industrialization are our topics, therefore. Beginning with economic organizations and practices, we will consider how these changed over time and influenced society and culture. The course takes take as its point of departure the experience of individual, working men and women: peasants and artisans, merchants and landlords, entrepreneurs and financiers. Yet, it argues outward: from the particular to the general, from the individual to the social, from the local to the global. It will suggests ways in which the economy influenced developments or changes that were not in themselves economic, and it will seek the ways in which non-material, transcendent beliefs, systems or values shaped and deflected economic life and practice."},{"label":"HIST 126: Modern Europe, 1789-1919","courseDescription":"It's old, it's new. It's unfamiliar, it's recognizable. This course investigates the collapse of the \"old regime\" and the birth of something like the Europe we recognize. The century and a half we cover in this course witnessed the development of the political, economic, and cultural phenomena we often see as characteristic of modern society. Topics considered include political revolution, industrialization, war, liberalism, imperialism, totalitarianism, and new ideologies of gender, race, and class. Our focus will be consistently transnational. How did European imperialism reshape the globe? How can the making of modern Europe help us understand the current travails of the European Union? How did borders and boundaries operate at the edge of nations, but also within societies? We will investigate these questions as we follow European history from the violence and optimism of the French Revolution to the total war of the twentieth century."},{"label":"HIST 131: Financial Meltdown, Past and Present","courseDescription":"Economic history is increasingly recognized as a crucial source of policy advice and is invoked with growing frequency in public debates. In particular, the subprime crisis in 2008 and after has generated a demand for \"historical perspective\" that would improve the understanding of the causes of financial turmoil and facilitate the prevention of comparable catastrophes. This course begins with a review of the principal features of the subprime crisis of 2008 and asks, so to speak, \"how did we get there?\" It answers by providing historical insights that shed light on crucial aspects of financial disasters. This is a history course, engaging with topics pertaining to economics, law and politics (national and international).

This course analyzes the Cuban and Guatemalan revolutions, as well as social movements that transformed the United States: the black freedom movement, the labor movement, and changing forms of Latino politics. In all three countries, Americans looked for ways to reform capitalism or build socialism; address entrenched patterns of racism; define and realize democracy; and achieve national independence. They conceived of these challenges in dramatically different ways. Together, we’ll compare national histories and analyze the relationships between national upheavals. In studying the US and Latin America together, the class allows students to explore central questions in both regions’ histories. What did capitalism, socialism, and communism amount to? What did democracy mean? What were the roots of racial inequality and how did Americans address it? Why were Americans so enticed by economic growth, and how did they pursue it? How did the Cold War shape social movements? What purposes did unions serve? How did Christianity inform movements for and against social change? Studying these regions together also allows us to explore international interactions. How did the black freedom movement in the US relate to the Cuban revolution? How did Latin American immigration shape the US labor movement? How did US Cold War policy influence Latin American revolutionary movements? The goal of this class is for you to interpret the readings and decide what you think. What you learn in this class, and the quality of our experience together, depends on your reading closely, coming to class with informed ideas and questions, and being prepared to help your classmates answer theirs. We will read approximately 100 pages per week. No background is required."},{"label":"HIST 308: Renaissance Europe ","courseDescription":"This course will examine the cultural and intellectual movement known as the Renaissance, from its origins in fourteenth-century Italy to its diffusion into the rest of Europe in the sixteenth century.

We will be reading primary sources as well as modern works."},{"label":"HIST 314: Victorian Britain: Spaces, Places, and Pests","courseDescription":"In this course, we will examine the nooks and crannies of Victorian society. It was a period of squalor, but also innovation, devastating diseases, and crucial advances in public health and medical science. Its cities featured depressing slums and lurid crimes, but also new kinds of spectacles, entertainments, and commodities. It was, in many ways, as one of its greatest authors wrote, \"the best of times, and the worst of times.\" Units under study will include \"The Docks,\" \"The Germs,\" \"The Empire,\" \"The Church,\" and \"the Museum.\" We'll investigate killer diseases like cholera and typhus, dazzling buildings like the Crystal Palace, imperial wars and crises, and new scientific movements like Darwinism and mesmerism. Along the way, we will encounter proper and eminent Victorians as well as scandalous and marginalized ones. The aim will be to understand Victorian mentalities and ideas by looking at a diverse array of institutions and inventions. Readings will include novels, stories, pamphlets, essays, and cartoons as well as secondary literature. Classes will be a mixture of lecture and discussion, and no previous experience in British history is necessary."},{"label":"HIST 331: American Diplomatic History Since 1776","courseDescription":"U.S. Diplomatic History since 1776 is a survey course examining the evolution of American foreign policy from the birth of our nation to the end of the Cold War.

During these centuries, the European great powers experienced significant internal transformations and also a revolution in their relations, both of which reinforced and accelerated each other. In the process, Europe asserted a dominant position in world politics, but also sowed the seed for the terrible castrophes of the 20th Century. The course will address this transformation of European diplomacy with special attention to the rivalries between the great powers, the impact of nationalism and emerging mass politics, the interplay between military and economic power, and the relationship between the European powers and the rest of the world."},{"label":"HIST 421: Europe and the World since 1914","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"}],"war_peace":[{"name":"War, Peace and Diplomacy","color":{"color":"#4169e1","highlight":"#85a0f0"},"description":"Lorem Ipsum"},{"label":"HIST 031: Making and Breaking European Hegemony","courseDescription":"Hist 031 will trace the dramatic rise and fall of Europe\\'s global hegemony during the period roughly from 1450 to 1950.

In the first half of the semester, we trace the Tang-Song transition, China 's exchange with central Asia and the threat of steppe normadism, which produced the Mongol and Manchu conquest dynasties. In the second half, we explore the achievements and disasters of the Ming, and we focus on the last imperial dynasty, the Qing. We study the Qing legacy and agent of change, both internal and external, that led to the 1911 republican revolution."},{"label":"HIST 097: History of Modern China","courseDescription":"From an empire to a republic, from communism to socialist-style capitalism, few countries have ever witnessed so much change in a hundred year period as China during the twentieth century. How are we to make sense out of this seeming chaos? This course will offer an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. We will start with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to a modern nation state, followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey will focus on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally, 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity."},{"label":"HIST 126: Modern Europe, 1789-1919","courseDescription":"It's old, it's new. It's unfamiliar, it's recognizable. This course investigates the collapse of the \"old regime\" and the birth of something like the Europe we recognize. The century and a half we cover in this course witnessed the development of the political, economic, and cultural phenomena we often see as characteristic of modern society. Topics considered include political revolution, industrialization, war, liberalism, imperialism, totalitarianism, and new ideologies of gender, race, and class. Our focus will be consistently transnational. How did European imperialism reshape the globe? How can the making of modern Europe help us understand the current travails of the European Union? How did borders and boundaries operate at the edge of nations, but also within societies? We will investigate these questions as we follow European history from the violence and optimism of the French Revolution to the total war of the twentieth century."},{"label":"HIST 135: Cold War Global History","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"},{"label":"HIST 178: The Foundations of the Early Modern Atlantic World 1450-1800","courseDescription":"The purpose of this course is to provide students with a solid knowledge of Atlantic history during the early modern period (XV-XVIII centuries).

It was a period of squalor, but also innovation, devastating diseases, and crucial advances in public health and medical science. Its cities featured depressing slums and lurid crimes, but also new kinds of spectacles, entertainments, and commodities. It was, in many ways, as one of its greatest authors wrote, \"the best of times, and the worst of times.\" Units under study will include \"The Docks,\" \"The Germs,\" \"The Empire,\" \"The Church,\" and \"the Museum.\" We'll investigate killer diseases like cholera and typhus, dazzling buildings like the Crystal Palace, imperial wars and crises, and new scientific movements like Darwinism and mesmerism.

This work, Tolstoy's War and Peace, is devoted to one of the most momentous periods in world history, the Era of the French Revolutions and the Napoleonic Wars (1789-1815). We will study both the novel and the Napoleonic era: the military campaigns of Napoleon and his opponents, the grand strategies of the age, political intrigues and diplomatic betrayals, the ideologies and beliefs, the human dramas, and the relationship between art and history. How does literature help us to understand this era? How does history help us to understand this great novel?

The course will address this transformation of European diplomacy with special attention to the rivalries between the great powers, the impact of nationalism and emerging mass politics, the interplay between military and economic power, and the relationship between the European powers and the rest of the world."},{"label":"HIST 421: Europe and the World since 1914","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"},{"label":"HIST 425: World War I","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"},{"label":"HIST 441: North American Colonial History","courseDescription":"A survey of the development of American colonial society, 1607-1750, with emphasis on the regional differences between life in early New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the South, as well as the relationships between British colonists, Native Americans, and African Americans."},{"label":"HIST 451: The U.S. and the World since 1898","courseDescription":"This class examines the emergence of the U.S. as a world power since 1898, and considers both the international and domestic consequences of U.S. foreign relations. In one respect, the twentieth century was a strange time to become a global empire: it was the period when colonial systems centered in Europe, Russia, Japan, and Turkey collapsed, and new nations emerged throughout Africa and Asia. This class explores the changing strategies of military, economic, and political intervention that the U.S. pursued as colonization lost legitimacy. Within that framework, the class invites students to think about several questions: How did the idea and practice of empire change over the twentieth century? How did the United States relate to new visions of independence emerging in Africa, Asia, and Latin America? How did global interactions both inform and reflect racial ideology in the United States?

We will begin by tracing some of the early origins of - and points of contact between - the Indian, Iberian, and African men and women who formed the basis of colonial society. As the course progresses, we will explore the variety of ways in which colonial subjects lived, worked, ate, worshipped, and socialized. Lectures and reading assignments will draw upon a variety of sources, including court cases, artistic renderings, city maps and street plans, travel accounts of visits to the regions, and the material, cultural, and intellectual products made possible by the wealth and dynamism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course will conclude with an analysis of the Age of Revolutions, a period of dramatic upheaval that remains at the center of lively scholarly debates.

The critique of religion had vast implications for the meaning of human life, the nature of the person, and the conception of political and social existence. The course will explore the intensifying debate over religion in the intellectual history of Europe, reaching from the Renaissance, through the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, to the twentieth century. Figures we will read may include Machiavelli, Hobbes, Spinoza, Pascal, Locke, Rousseau, Voltaire, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. These thinkers allow us to trace the varieties of irreligious experience that have emerged in modern European thought and their implications for both historical and philosophical understanding. Rather than drawing a straight line from belief to non-belief, however, we will also consider whether religion lingers even in secular thought and culture."},{"label":"HIST 150: American Jewish Experience","courseDescription":"This course offers a comprehensive survey of American Jewish history from the colonial period to the present.

England was re-constructed as a republic, then with Scotland became the United Commonwealth of Great Britain, then declined into a military dictatorship, and finally invited the king back. In 1688, however, the Glorious Revolution deposed that king and declared Britain a strictly constitutional monarchy. This course will explore what motivated ordinarily obedient British subjects to take up arms against their rulers. The works of Milton and Marvell, Cromwell, Hobbes and Locke, and many lesser-known writers of diaries, autobiographies, sermons, statutes, and letters will illuminate the issues. The focus will be on how law, politics and religion interacted in the onset of war and defining of settlement, but with an eye to the larger social and cultural setting in which revolutions happened: this is also an era of both witchcraze and scientific revolution, puritanism and the slave trade, the near-destruction of London by fire and plague and its re-birth as the capital of a commercial empire."},{"label":"HIST 380: Modern Jewish Intellectual and Cultural History ","courseDescription":"An overview of Jewish intellectual and cultural history from the late 18th century until the present.

In the first half of the course, we will explore the long history across the West of the regulation of various kinds of ideas and their expression, from malicious gossip to heresies, and read classic arguments for and against censorship, copyright protections, and standards of taste and decency and of truth. In the second part of the seminar, after looking at how the idea of freedom of speech came to seem an essential prerequisite for democracy as well as individual liberty, we will take up the historical and philosophical questions posed by such recent dilemmas as whether or not hate speech deserves the protection of the First Amendment, the distinction between art and pornography from the perspective of freedom of expression, speech during wartime, and the transformative effects of the internet on the circulation and regulation of ideas. We will end the semester by thinking about the globalization of the idea of free speech as a human right and its implications, both positive and negative. Readings will range from Robert Darnton’s The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France, to D. H.

It was a time of great transition. Europe developed from an agriculturally-based to an industrially-based economy, with attendant changes in society and culture. From a subsistence-level productivity, the European economy expanded to create great surfeits of good, with attendant changes in consumption and expectation. Europe grew from a regional economic system to become part—some would day the heart—of a global economy, with attendant changes in worldview and identity. Economic intensification, expansion, globalization and industrialization are our topics, therefore. Beginning with economic organizations and practices, we will consider how these changed over time and influenced society and culture. The course takes take as its point of departure the experience of individual, working men and women: peasants and artisans, merchants and landlords, entrepreneurs and financiers. Yet, it argues outward: from the particular to the general, from the individual to the social, from the local to the global. It will suggests ways in which the economy influenced developments or changes that were not in themselves economic, and it will seek the ways in which non-material, transcendent beliefs, systems or values shaped and deflected economic life and practice."},{"label":"HIST 161: American Capitalism","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"},{"label":"HIST 343: Nineteenth Century European Intellectual History","courseDescription":"This course will examine major political, philosophical, and cultural issues during the period, beginning with the Enlightenment and its legacies and concluding with Nietzsche's dismissal of the entire Enlightenment project.

The course approaches major works, dealing with the historical importance of information (Foucault, Innis, Habermas) and simultaneously discusses the rise and fall of institutions to store and circulate information. This is achieved through an empirical, narrative approach, via the study of historical processes such as imperialism, state building, propaganda, the police archives and the politics of memory."}],"slavery_race":[{"name":"Slavery and Race","color":{"color":"#f3cc07","highlight":"#f6e484"},"description":"Lorem Ipsum"},{"label":"HIST 011: Deciphering America","courseDescription":"This course examines American history from the first contacts of the indigenous peoples of North America with European settlers to our own times by focusing on a few telling moments in this history.

This course analyzes the Cuban and Guatemalan revolutions, as well as social movements that transformed the United States: the black freedom movement, the labor movement, and changing forms of Latino politics. In all three countries, Americans looked for ways to reform capitalism or build socialism; address entrenched patterns of racism; define and realize democracy; and achieve national independence. They conceived of these challenges in dramatically different ways. Together, we’ll compare national histories and analyze the relationships between national upheavals. In studying the US and Latin America together, the class allows students to explore central questions in both regions’ histories. What did capitalism, socialism, and communism amount to? What did democracy mean? What were the roots of racial inequality and how did Americans address it? Why were Americans so enticed by economic growth, and how did they pursue it? How did the Cold War shape social movements? What purposes did unions serve? How did Christianity inform movements for and against social change? Studying these regions together also allows us to explore international interactions. How did the black freedom movement in the US relate to the Cuban revolution? How did Latin American immigration shape the US labor movement? How did US Cold War policy influence Latin American revolutionary movements? The goal of this class is for you to interpret the readings and decide what you think.

In the first half of the semester, we trace the Tang-Song transition, China 's exchange with central Asia and the threat of steppe normadism, which produced the Mongol and Manchu conquest dynasties. In the second half, we explore the achievements and disasters of the Ming, and we focus on the last imperial dynasty, the Qing. We study the Qing legacy and agent of change, both internal and external, that led to the 1911 republican revolution."},{"label":"HIST 097: History of Modern China","courseDescription":"From an empire to a republic, from communism to socialist-style capitalism, few countries have ever witnessed so much change in a hundred year period as China during the twentieth century. How are we to make sense out of this seeming chaos? This course will offer an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. We will start with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to a modern nation state, followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey will focus on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally, 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity."},{"label":"HIST 108: American Origins","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"},{"label":"HIST 126: Modern Europe, 1789-1919","courseDescription":"It's old, it's new. It's unfamiliar, it's recognizable. This course investigates the collapse of the \"old regime\" and the birth of something like the Europe we recognize. The century and a half we cover in this course witnessed the development of the political, economic, and cultural phenomena we often see as characteristic of modern society. Topics considered include political revolution, industrialization, war, liberalism, imperialism, totalitarianism, and new ideologies of gender, race, and class. Our focus will be consistently transnational. How did European imperialism reshape the globe? How can the making of modern Europe help us understand the current travails of the European Union? How did borders and boundaries operate at the edge of nations, but also within societies? We will investigate these questions as we follow European history from the violence and optimism of the French Revolution to the total war of the twentieth century."},{"label":"HIST 131: Financial Meltdown, Past and Present","courseDescription":"Economic history is increasingly recognized as a crucial source of policy advice and is invoked with growing frequency in public debates. In particular, the subprime crisis in 2008 and after has generated a demand for \"historical perspective\" that would improve the understanding of the causes of financial turmoil and facilitate the prevention of comparable catastrophes. This course begins with a review of the principal features of the subprime crisis of 2008 and asks, so to speak, \"how did we get there?\" It answers by providing historical insights that shed light on crucial aspects of financial disasters. This is a history course, engaging with topics pertaining to economics, law and politics (national and international). Students with diverse backgrounds are expected to benefit from this course through acquiring a concrete knowledge of the historical evolution of fundamental institutions of financial capitalism. Ultimately, students enrolling in this course are expected to achieve proficiency in historically informed discussion of the mechanisms that were played out in the subprime crisis and beyond."},{"label":"HIST 133: Free Speech and Censorship","courseDescription":"This course will explore the idea of free speech—its justification, its relationship to various forms of censorship, and its proper limits—as a historical, philosophical, legal, and ultimately, political question. In the first half of the course, we will explore the long history across the West of the regulation of various kinds of ideas and their expression, from malicious gossip to heresies, and read classic arguments for and against censorship, copyright protections, and standards of taste and decency and of truth. In the second part of the seminar, after looking at how the idea of freedom of speech came to seem an essential prerequisite for democracy as well as individual liberty, we will take up the historical and philosophical questions posed by such recent dilemmas as whether or not hate speech deserves the protection of the First Amendment, the distinction between art and pornography from the perspective of freedom of expression, speech during wartime, and the transformative effects of the internet on the circulation and regulation of ideas. We will end the semester by thinking about the globalization of the idea of free speech as a human right and its implications, both positive and negative. Readings will range from Robert Darnton’s The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France, to D. H. Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover, to documents concerning the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo and law review articles about Citizens United v. FEC. We will also make considerable use of local resources, from museums to the library."},{"label":"HIST 135: Cold War Global History","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"},{"label":"HIST 141: Jews in the Modern World","courseDescription":"This course offers an intensive survey of the major currents in Jewish culture and society from the late middle ages to the present.

This course analyzes the Cuban and Guatemalan revolutions, as well as social movements that transformed the United States: the black freedom movement, the labor movement, and changing forms of Latino politics. In all three countries, Americans looked for ways to reform capitalism or build socialism; address entrenched patterns of racism; define and realize democracy; and achieve national independence. They conceived of these challenges in dramatically different ways. Together, we’ll compare national histories and analyze the relationships between national upheavals. In studying the US and Latin America together, the class allows students to explore central questions in both regions’ histories. What did capitalism, socialism, and communism amount to? What did democracy mean? What were the roots of racial inequality and how did Americans address it? Why were Americans so enticed by economic growth, and how did they pursue it? How did the Cold War shape social movements? What purposes did unions serve? How did Christianity inform movements for and against social change? Studying these regions together also allows us to explore international interactions. How did the black freedom movement in the US relate to the Cuban revolution? How did Latin American immigration shape the US labor movement? How did US Cold War policy influence Latin American revolutionary movements? The goal of this class is for you to interpret the readings and decide what you think. What you learn in this class, and the quality of our experience together, depends on your reading closely, coming to class with informed ideas and questions, and being prepared to help your classmates answer theirs. We will read approximately 100 pages per week. No background is required."},{"label":"HIST 178: The Foundations of the Early Modern Atlantic World 1450-1800","courseDescription":"The purpose of this course is to provide students with a solid knowledge of Atlantic history during the early modern period (XV-XVIII centuries).

England was re-constructed as a republic, then with Scotland became the United Commonwealth of Great Britain, then declined into a military dictatorship, and finally invited the king back. In 1688, however, the Glorious Revolution deposed that king and declared Britain a strictly constitutional monarchy. This course will explore what motivated ordinarily obedient British subjects to take up arms against their rulers. The works of Milton and Marvell, Cromwell, Hobbes and Locke, and many lesser-known writers of diaries, autobiographies, sermons, statutes, and letters will illuminate the issues. The focus will be on how law, politics and religion interacted in the onset of war and defining of settlement, but with an eye to the larger social and cultural setting in which revolutions happened: this is also an era of both witchcraze and scientific revolution, puritanism and the slave trade, the near-destruction of London by fire and plague and its re-birth as the capital of a commercial empire."},{"label":"HIST 313: The French Revolution and the Origins of Modern Politics","courseDescription":"This course will examine the social, cultural, intellectual, economic, and especially political history of France and its overseas (especially Caribbean) empire from the end of the Old Regime through the Napoleonic period. The origins, development, and outcome of the French Revolution, followed by the Haitian Revolution, will be our main focus. Particular attention will be paid to the global legacy of these two late 18th-century revolutions in terms of such key modern political concepts as human rights, nationalism, social welfare, feminism, democracy, terrorism, and revolution itself. Throughout the course, we will also emphasize the different and often conflicting ways in which historians have interpreted the meaning and consequences of this critical moment of upheaval. Readings will be a mixture of primary and secondary sources, and classes will combine lecture and discussion. Requirements will be one mid-term examination (15%), one short paper of 4 pages (15%), one final paper of 8-9 pages (30%), and one final examination (30%), as well as class participation (10%)."},{"label":"HIST 314: Victorian Britain: Spaces, Places, and Pests","courseDescription":"In this course, we will examine the nooks and crannies of Victorian society. It was a period of squalor, but also innovation, devastating diseases, and crucial advances in public health and medical science. Its cities featured depressing slums and lurid crimes, but also new kinds of spectacles, entertainments, and commodities. It was, in many ways, as one of its greatest authors wrote, \"the best of times, and the worst of times.\" Units under study will include \"The Docks,\" \"The Germs,\" \"The Empire,\" \"The Church,\" and \"the Museum.\" We'll investigate killer diseases like cholera and typhus, dazzling buildings like the Crystal Palace, imperial wars and crises, and new scientific movements like Darwinism and mesmerism. Along the way, we will encounter proper and eminent Victorians as well as scandalous and marginalized ones. The aim will be to understand Victorian mentalities and ideas by looking at a diverse array of institutions and inventions. Readings will include novels, stories, pamphlets, essays, and cartoons as well as secondary literature. Classes will be a mixture of lecture and discussion, and no previous experience in British history is necessary."},{"label":"HIST 331: American Diplomatic History Since 1776","courseDescription":"U.S. Diplomatic History since 1776 is a survey course examining the evolution of American foreign policy from the birth of our nation to the end of the Cold War.

During these centuries, the European great powers experienced significant internal transformations and also a revolution in their relations, both of which reinforced and accelerated each other. In the process, Europe asserted a dominant position in world politics, but also sowed the seed for the terrible castrophes of the 20th Century. The course will address this transformation of European diplomacy with special attention to the rivalries between the great powers, the impact of nationalism and emerging mass politics, the interplay between military and economic power, and the relationship between the European powers and the rest of the world."},{"label":"HIST 421: Europe and the World since 1914","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"},{"label":"HIST 425: World War I","courseDescription":"No Description Provided"}],"gender_sexuality":[{"name":"Gender and Sexuality","color":{"color":"#ff9464","highlight":"#f29f7a"},"description":"Lorem Ipsum"},{"label":"HIST 011: Deciphering America","courseDescription":"This course examines American history from the first contacts of the indigenous peoples of North America with European settlers to our own times by focusing on a few telling moments in this history. The course treats twelve of these moments. Each unit begins with a specific primary document, historical figure, image, location, year, or cultural artifact to commence the delving into the American past. Some of these icons are familiar, but the ensuing deciphering will render them as more complicated; some are unfamiliar, but they will emerge as absolutely telling. The course meets each week for two 50-minute team-taught lectures and once recitation session. Course requirements include: in-class midterm and final exams; three short paper assignments; and punctual attendance and participation in recitations."},{"label":"HIST 307: Love Lust & Violence in the Middle Ages","courseDescription":"Medieval Europe was undoubtedly gruff and violent but it also gave birth to courtly culture - raw worries transformed into knights who performed heroic deeds, troubadours wrote epics in their honor and love songs about their ladies, women of the elite carved out a place in public discourse as patrons of the arts, and princely courts were increasingly defined by pageantry from jousting tournaments to royal coronations. This course will trace the development of this courtly culture from the eleventh to the sixteenth century, from its roots in Southern France to its spread to Northern France and then to various kingdoms in Europe."},{"label":"HIST 313: The French Revolution and the Origins of Modern Politics","courseDescription":"This course will examine the social, cultural, intellectual, economic, and especially political history of France and its overseas (especially Caribbean) empire from the end of the Old Regime through the Napoleonic period.
